# Colliding Vehicle Determiner (CVD)

Colliding Vehicle Determiner (CVD) is an Electron app that demonstrates the capabilities of the machine learning pipeline from the thesis project ***"Determining the Colliding Vehicle in Traffic Accidents using Hybrid Machine Learning Algorithms"***.

## Requirements

### Node.js
CVD requires Node.js 16+ to run the Electron app. On Windows 10, download a pre-built package from the Node.js [website][node]. On Linux and macOS, you can use [nvm][nvm] to install Node.js. For example, to install with `nvm` with [Homebrew][brew], and then install the latest version of Node:

```sh
brew install nvm
nvm install node
```

### Python
Python is required to run the scripts for the machine learning algorithms. It can be downloaded from Python's [downloads page][python].
